Under Windows platform:
1. Open inetcpl.cpl in cmd
2. 'connections' tab -> 'LAN setting' -> 'Use a proxy server' -> 'advance' -> 'socks' -> add '127.0.0.1' and a port, such as 9898 
3. In Putty, go to 'SSH tunnels' -> 'source' add the above port -> choose 'dynamic' -> 'Add' -> start connection
4. In the terminal, first 'ssh -N -f -L localhost:9898:localhost:9999 username@targetserver'. First "localhost:9898" is the address and port in the first server, and the second "localhost:9999" is the address and port (which is set when jupyter notebook is launched).
5. Again, 'ssh server', login. 'jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=9999' will launch jupyter notebook
6. In browser, type 'localhost:9898' to initialize jupyter notebook. Note the token is generated by step 5.
7. Don't forget to 'fuser -k 9898/tcp' on the first server to unbind the two port !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Under Linux:
Same as in Windows, except Step 1 and 2 can be omitted.
