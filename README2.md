# Implementing Neural Network model based on CUDA/CUDNN/CUBLAS, and two tester cases of "NN_L2H2O_poly2d" with different precisions

## General
These codes model the complete workflow of performing prediction based on Neural Network model in C++ and with CUDA/CUDNN/CUBLAS libraries and HDF5 support.  
It will read out layers names, weights and bias from an HDF5 file in sequence, then create layers based on their type, and predict final scores by the input samples.

### For class file *readhdf5.hpp* reading HDF5 file:  
This file uses HDF5 library C++ API, and offers functions:
   - to read an attribute name and all saved attribute data (usually strings) in a HDF5 file group, retaining the order (usually by creation time).
      - This function can be used to retrieve Neural Network layer names in the group "/model_weights/" of a given HDF5 file
      - Or can be used to retrieve dataset names (weight and bias) saved for each layer
   - to read out a dataset data by the dataset path in the HDF5 file.
      - This function can be used to obtain a layer's weight and bias, given the absolute path is retrieved by the first function. 
    
### For class file *network.cu* modelling Neural Network layers and algorithms:
This file uses CUDA/CUDNN/CUBLAS libraries, and offers:  
   - Layer creation, including normal dense layers, and activiation layers. Saved weights and bias of dense layers are initialized on both host and device.
   - Neural Network algorithms, include:
       - fully connected forward, based on function `cublasSgemm()` or `cublasDgemm()` according to data precision  
          - `cublasSgemm()` is a function utilizing cublas library to perform fast algebra dot product of *m[atrix]* and *m[atrix]* in **single** floating point precision. Similarly, 
          - `cublasDgemm()` perform *matrix* dot *matrix* in **double** float precision
          - `cublasDgemv()` perform *matrix* dot *vector* in **double** float precision
       - softmax forwards, using `cudnnSoftmaxForward()`
       - Activation_TANH forwards, using `cudnnActivationForward()` with CUDNN_ACTIVATION_TANH to define the activiation type as hyperbolic tangential
       - Activation_ReLU forwards, using `cudnnActivationForward()` with CUDNN_ACTIVATION_RELU to define the activiation type as ReLU nonlinearity
   - Layer list creation, saving a list of layers and automatically performing prediction according to layer types. 

### For the provided tester:  
This tester is from repo /paesanilab/NeuralNets/testcase_forCUDA/ which is originally written in Python with Keras/Theano support.  
In that repo, the trained layers weights/bias were saved in a HDF5 file, and testing samples were written to a text file (in different precisons, respectively).  
The above files are loaded by this C++ code attemping to reproduce similar results as in Python, for the purpose of testing CUDA/CUDNN/CUBLAS utility in C++.  
File *python.out* contains the results from Keras/Theano based Python program.  

The results in single floating point precision tester have a difference of around 1e-7, and in double floating point precision have a difference of around 1e-15.
    
## TO RUN
To make executive files:
   - Make sure **cuda/cudnn** and **hdf5** libraries are installed. Makefile will look for environment variable *CUDA_PATH/CUDNN_PATH/HDF5_PATH* to locate the installed library and included header files. If not found, it will look for /usr/local/cuda and /usr/local/hdf5. If not found, it will fail.
   - If the libraries paths are correctly found, type "make" to make the executive file.
   - Run `NN_L2H2O_poly2d` for testing.
   - Compare the final output scores with what are from Python Keras/Theano.
